# Hands on network analysis

Project: Domestic migration flows in Finland


Was done in collaboration with three other students.
Was migrated from Gitlab to here, hence the Git history is unfortunately not available. Again, minimal code changes were done as the code was imported as-is. The code has been run through to make sure that it works, with minor updates to ensure that newer package versions work with the code.


MAYBE I SHOULD CLEAN THIS UP??
