# Domestic migration flows in Finland

This is a school group work project from 2022 that investigated domestic migration flows in Finland, especially during 2020. This project was completed as part of a network analysis course. The goal of the investigation was to be able to draw migration networks on a Finnish map, and show which are the largest migration links inside Finland in which direction people are moving in 2020. 

**Outcomes:**

`docs/progress_report.pdf`: A progess report of the project. Contains all relevant information and visualizations, including demographics analysis and different spanning network visualizations.

`images/`:
A folder containing interesting images from the presentation

- `network_on_map.png`: a visualization of the migration network on the Finnish map
- `net_migration_per_sex_2020.png`: Sex-partitioned migration in the Top 10 cities by population.
- `rank_sum_migration_timeseries.png`: Time series of rank of population-normalized migration for the top 10 cities. Show how the migration ranks have evolved since 2018.

The rest are other interesting time-series plots of migration.


Was done in collaboration with three other students.

NOTE That it is possible that some of the code might not work at the moment, but the
