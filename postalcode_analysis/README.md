# Finnish postal code area analysis


one point of the notebooks is to review and prepare the data so that it can be used in the clustering task.

i did this in parts because it was a lot easier to get a better understanding of feature sets when evaluating them by smaller groups + the columns were already divided into groups by theme. 

To improve: Bring timeframe into question, a.k.a calculate changes in these values
- yoy change
- 5 year change

To improve: bring in migration figures? 
- i dont know what to do with this though, because i will probably only be able to get municipality-level migration figures --> postcodes in municipality will get same values --> data will force algorithm to group same-municipality postcodes together. 


## Project Description

This project aims to explore Finnish postal code areas using Paavo data. Paavo is a comprehensive dataset provided by Statistics Finland, which contains various socio-economic and demographic information at the postal code level.

The main objectives of this project are:

1. Data Collection: Retrieve the Paavo dataset for Finnish postal code areas.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and transform the raw data into a suitable format for analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Perform descriptive statistics, visualizations, and uncover insights about the postal code areas.
4. Geospatial Analysis: Utilize geospatial techniques to visualize the distribution of variables across different postal code areas.
5. Statistical Modeling: Apply statistical models to identify patterns, correlations, and potential predictors within the dataset.
6. Interpretation and Reporting: Summarize the findings, draw conclusions, and present the results in a clear and concise manner.

By conducting this analysis, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the socio-economic and demographic characteristics of Finnish postal code areas. This information can be valuable for various purposes, such as urban planning, market research, and resource allocation.

## Data Sources

The primary data source for this project is the Paavo dataset provided by Statistics Finland. The dataset includes variables such as population, age distribution, education level, income, and more at the postal code level.

## Tools and Technologies

The following tools and technologies will be used for this project:

- Programming Language: Python
