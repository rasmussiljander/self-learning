# Self-learning Projects

This repository serves as a hub for miscellaneous self-learning projects related to data and machine learning. Each project is partitioned into its own directory in the repository root. With this, it is easier for me to see the topics that I have already explored and helps me understand what possible gaps I might still have in my understanding.

Below are short explanations of each project.

### 2D Shape Recognition

`2D_shape_recognition/`

A simple deep learning project, training a convolutional neural network from scratch to classify images into circles, squares, or triangles. The project serves as a quick review of CNNs and helps me refresh what I already learned in school and have something similar that I have implemented in my own.
