# This code implements a 2D shape recognition model using machine learning techniques.
# It takes a dataset of 2D shapes as input and trains a model to classify them into different shape categories.
# The architecture used for the model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) with multiple layers.
# The dataset contains images of various 2D shapes such as circles, squares, triangles, and rectangles.
# Each image is labeled with the corresponding shape category.
# The model is trained using the labeled dataset to learn the patterns and features of different shapes.
# Once trained, the model can be used to predict the shape category of new unseen images.
# The output of the model is the predicted shape category for each input image.

# To install the required environment, you can use the provided YAML file.
# Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

# 1. Create a new virtual environment (optional but recommended):
#    $ python -m venv shape_recognition_env
#    $ source shape_recognition_env/bin/activate

# 2. Install the required packages using the provided YAML file:
#    $ conda env create -f environment.yml

# 3. Activate the environment:
#    $ conda activate shape_recognition_env

# 4. Run the code:
#    $ python shape_recognition.py

# The sample output of the code will display the predicted shape category for each input image in the dataset.

# Note: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as Python, Conda, and the required packages specified in the YAML file.
