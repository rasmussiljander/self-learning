# Time Series Analysis of Wolt Orders During Fall 2020

This project was completed in conjunction to an application for a summer internship in early 2021. The zip-file contains the public data set as well as the Jupyter Notebook file, where the analysis itself is written.

It has been migrated to this repo *as is*, and has hence not been touched since 2021.


## Analysis Contents

The analysis takes a look at daily order data and tries to fit various SARIMA models, estimated based on autocorrelation function plots as well as partial autocorrelation plots. Models were evaluated on Akaike Information Criterion, Residual plots, as well as forecasting ability. At the end of the report, various imporvement opportunities are discussed. The analysis is written with **Python**


## Running the code

You can run the code in any environment that supports jupyter notebook kernels, but for example, you can create and run a virtual environment with the `requirements.txt`-file, and run the kernel in Visual Studio Code.
